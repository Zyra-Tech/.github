# 👩🏻‍💻 Welcome to Zyra.Tech — Engineering Cloud-Native Futures

> *“We build resilient systems for resilient minds.”*  

Zyra.Tech is an innovation-focused web3 / cloud technology collective founded by Richie Bartlett. Our projects span **infrastructure automation**, **digital identity**, **professional blogging frameworks**, and **AI-driven personalization** — all rooted in a deeply modular AWS architecture.

## 🚀 What We Build

At Zyra.Tech, we focus on tools and automation for solopreneurs, developers, and creators. Our public codebases include:

- ⚙️ **Infrastructure-as-Code**: Multi-account AWS Organization provisioning scripts with SSO, GuardDuty, ACM, Route53, and CloudFront integrations.
- 🌐 **HEXO Blogging Frameworks**: Enhanced themes and plugins for professional publishing, social syndication, and automation-ready content pipelines.
- 🤖 **AI-Integrated Workflows**: Structured personality frameworks for digital assistants, YouTube transcript processors, and Markdown optimizers.
- 📦 **Serverless Microservices**: Lambda-powered workflows for scalable domain cutovers, analytics pipelines, and event-driven resource creation.

## 🧱 Our Philosophy

We believe in:

- **Cloud-first** design with minimal operational overhead.
- **Automation over repetition**: every script is designed for reuse and scaling.
- **Open source contribution** to accelerate ethical tech ecosystems.
- **Technocratic principles** guiding efficient, logical design.
